DML(Data Manipulation language):use to insert,update and delete the data from table
 1.Insert:insert into <tablename> values();
          insert into <tablename> <c1,c2,c3> values (1,2,3);
          insert into <tablename> <c1,c2,c3> values (1,2,3),(4,5,6);
 2.Update:update <TableName> 
          set <columnname>='   '
          where id=1;
          
          MORE THAN ONE COLUMN AT ONE TIME       
          update <TableName> 
          set <columnname>='   ',<columnname>=''
          where id=1;

EXIST OPERATOR

The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers WHERE EXISTS 
(SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22);

    SQL ANY
    The ANY and ALL operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause.
    The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.
    The ALL operator returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition.
    
    SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE
    ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
    
    ALL Operators
    The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the product names 
    if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10 (so, this example will return FALSE, 
    because not ALL records in the OrderDetails table has quantity = 10):
    
    SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE
    ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

    SELECT INTO STATEMENT
    The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.
  
  The following SQL statement uses the IN clause to copy the table into a new table in another database:
      SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
     FROM Customers;
     
     SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
     FROM Customers;
     ==================================================================================================================================
     INSERT INTO SELECT Statement
    The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

     INSERT INTO SELECT requires that data types in source and target tables match
     The existing records in the target table are unaffected
     
     The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):

     Example
     INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
     SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
