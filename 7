JOIN:it is used to fetch data from multiple table using single statement
     There must be relation between table
     
Types of joins:
    1.inner join:its retreive data from both the table only which is matching in both table;
    
                 SELECT Customers.CustomerName,Categories.CategoryName Customers
                 INNER JOIN Categories on Customers.CustomerID=Categories.CategoryID;
                 
                 Select C.CustomerName,Cat.Categoryname Customers C
                 INNER JOIN Categories cat ON C.CustomerID=Cat.CategoryID
                 ORDER BY c.CustomerID;
                 
    2.left join:return the left table and only the matching value from right table;
                  SELECT Customers.CustomerName,Categories.CategoryName Customers
                 LEFT JOIN Categories on Customers.CustomerID=Categories.CategoryID;
                 
                 Select C.CustomerName,Cat.Categoryname Customers C
                 LEFT JOIN Categories cat ON C.CustomerID=Cat.CategoryID
                 ORDER BY c.CustomerID LIMIT 10;
                
                
    3.right join:return the right table and only the matching value  from left table;
                   SELECT Customers.CustomerName,Categories.CategoryName Customers
                 RIGHT JOIN Categories on Customers.CustomerID=Categories.CategoryID;
                 
                 Select C.CustomerName,Cat.Categoryname Customers C
                 RIGHT JOIN Categories cat ON C.CustomerID=Cat.CategoryID
                 ORDER BY c.CustomerID LIMIT 10;
    4.Self Join:A self JOIN occurs when a table takes a 'selfie'.
                A self JOIN is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.
                This can be useful when modeling hierarchies.
                They are also useful for comparisons within a table.
                
                SELECT column-names
                FROM table-name T1 JOIN table-name T2
                WHERE condition
                
                
                
    5.cross join:The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table
               multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN.
              This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.

              If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN.
              
              SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
              
             
    
    
    4.outer join:return the whole value from both the table
    NOT IN MYSQL
    
    ~~~~~~~Joining more than 2 table~~~~~~~~~~
                 Select C.CustomerName,Cat.Categoryname Customers C
                 JOIN Categories cat ON C.CustomerID=Cat.CategoryID
                 JOIN <THIRDTABLE>.X ON C.CustomerID=x.<column>
