          Relationship:
   tables are  related to each other through primary key and foreign key
   types of relationship:
  
  1.one to one
      where key to one table appear no more than once as the key of another table and vice versa.
      In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table.
      For example, in a school database, each student has only one student ID, and each student ID is assigned to only one person.
  
  2.one to many
       In a one-to-many relationship, one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table. 
       For example, each customer can have many sales orders.
       The foreign key field in the Orders table, Customer ID, is designed to allow multiple instances of the same value
  
  3.many to many
      A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. 
      For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products:
      customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers
