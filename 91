 GROUP BY and HAVING use
   
    **group by** 
     select count(<columnname>) from <tablename> //This statement gives total number of rows
      for for any particuler column then use group by
      
       select count(<columnname>) from <tablename> group by <columnname>
       
     **having**
     we can not use where with group by hence we are using having 
      example:  select count(<columnname>) from <tablename> group by <columnname> having id >5;
